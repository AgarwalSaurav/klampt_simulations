# Kinematic simulations using Klampt

### Execution:
```
cd simTests
python kinematicSim.py simpleWorld.xml
```

### Robot files

  The folder `mobile_robots` contain the descriptions of the following robots:
1. kobuki: It has the base of TurtleBot. It is a differential drive system with
   two degrees of freedom. Can be forced as a holonomic robot with three degrees
   of freedom.
2. turtlebot: Differential drive robot with two degrees of freedom.
3. R2-D2: Can be used as a differential drive robot.
4. sphero: It is a three degrees of freedom robot. However, it can be forced as
   a six DoF system as done in the sampls.
